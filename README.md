This project demonstrates **business data analysis and visualization** using Python.  
The dataset (simulated sales data) includes order details, customer segments, regions, sales, and profit.  
The goal is to create **insights and dashboards** to support business decision-making, similar to real-world Business Analyst tasks.

- 📈 Sales trend visualization over time  
- 🛍️ Sales vs Profit analysis by customer segment  
## Tools Used

- Sales trend shows seasonal fluctuations.  
- Retail generates higher sales volume with mixed profitability.  
## How to Run
1. Clone the repo or open in Google Colab.  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`
